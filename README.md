# Coding-Challenges
Different Coding Questions on Data Structure and Algorithm concepts

This Folder contains the following:
- moveFiles.bash; A bash script I used to initialize folders and README.md for all .py files in the same directory (Use with Caution).
- group.py ; A python script I used to breakdown the content of original README file into several README files.
- Folders containing multiple questions and groups of questions.

Each Question is a Folder with a:
- .py file containing the source code
- readme.md file containing important info about the question.

I made my comments as descriptive as I could, enjoy!
