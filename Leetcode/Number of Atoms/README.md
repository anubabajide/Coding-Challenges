19. Number of Atoms :
    1. Problem: Given a chemical equation that could contain brackets of elements and numbers ((H2O), (Na(OH)2), H2SO4); return a string with all elements inn sorted order and their number of occurences (exlude 1) ((H2O), (H2NaO2), (H2O4S))
    2. Solution: Using a queue and expanding brackets 
    3. Time Complexity: O(nlogn) n=number of distinct elelments
