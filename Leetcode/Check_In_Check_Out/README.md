    1. Problem: Given a subway scenario with users that own cards, design a system that performs three functions:
	-Swipe In(UserID, Location, Time): A user checks in the subway at a time and location
	-Swipe Out(UserID, Location, Time): A user checks out the subway at a time and location
	-Get Average(FromLocation, ToLocation): Returns the average duration of a Trip
    2. Solution: Use two dictionaries to store customer info and Trip info
    3. Time Complexity: O(1) for all functions
