10. Circular Queue Design :
    Problem: Create a circular queue class that takes an int, creates a circular queue of size int and has the following functions:
      1. Enqueue - Adds an item to the back of the queue. If queue is full, return false. [Time Complexity - O(1)]
      2. Dequeue - Removes the item at the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, return false. [Time Complexity - O(1)]
      3. Front - Returns the item at the front of the queue. If the queue is empty, return false. [Time Complexity - O(1)]
      4. Rear - Returns the item at the back of the queue. If the queue is empty, return false. [Time Complexity - O(1)]
      5. isEmpty - Returns True if queue is empty, false otherwise. [Time Complexity - O(1)]
      6. isFull - Returns True if the queue is full, false otherwise. [Time Complexity - O(1)]
